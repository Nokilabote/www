== Introduction

[.lead]
ASST0 introduces you to the codebase and tools that you will be using
throughout the rest of the `ops-class.org` assignments.

It is unlikely that you have used OS/161 before, but some of the
other tools may be familiar to you:

* http://os161.eecs.harvard.edu[*OS/161*]: OS/161 includes both
. the sources of the the operating system you will be designing,
implementing, running and debugging, and
. `sys161`, the machine simulator which will run your operating system.
* https://git-scm.com/[*Git*]: a fast distributed source control system that
tracks and saves your changes to OS/161 and enables effective collaboration.
* https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/[*GDB*]: the GNU debugger, a powerful
debugging tool which will allow you to control and inspect your running
system.
