== Today

* Review address translation.
* Page translation and the TLB.

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* This is it! The last week for ASST2!
** A reminder: 421/521 assignments are cumulative and we do not distribute
solution sets without penalty.
* Midterm will cover everything through *Friday*.
* ASST2 turn-in party Friday starting after class, in and around Davis 303.

<<<

* A leader board is coming! (And it includes privacy settings, obviously.)

[.nooutline]
== PS: ASST2 and ASST3 Are Hard

[.slider]
* Hopefully you've realized this by now.

== Efficient Translation

*Goal*: [.slide]#almost _every_ virtual address translation should be able to
proceed without kernel assistance.#

[.slider]
.*Why?*
* The kernel is *too slow*!

[.slider]
* Recall: kernel sets [.slide]*policy*, hardware provides the [.slide]*mechanism*.

[.nooutline]
== Implicit Translation

[.slider]
* _Process:_ "Machine! Store to address 0x10000!"
* _MMU:_ "Where the heck is virtual address 0x10000 supposed to map to?
Kernel...help!"
* (Exception.)
* _Kernel:_ Machine, virtual address 0x10000 maps to physical address
0x567400.
* _MMU:_ Thanks! Process: store completed!
* _Process:_ KTHXBAI.

[.nooutline]
== [.spelling_exception]#K.I.S.S.: Base and Bound#

*Simplest* virtual address mapping approach.

[.slider]
. Assign each process a *base* physical address and *bound*.
. *Check:* Virtual Address is OK if Virtual Address < bound.
. *Translate:* Physical Address = Virtual Address + base

[.nooutline]
== Base and Bounds: Cons

[.slider]
* Con: Not a good fit for our address space abstraction which encourages
discontiguous allocation. Base and bounds allocation must be mostly
contiguous otherwise we will lose
memory to _internal_ fragmentation.
* Con: also significant chance of *external* fragmentation due to large
contiguous allocations.

[.nooutline]
== [.spelling_exception]#K.I.Simplish.S.: Segmentation#

[.slider]
* Multiple bases and bounds per process, each called a
*segment*.

[.slider]
. Each *segment* has a *start* virtual address, *base* physical
address, and *bound*.
. *Check:* Virtual Address is OK if it inside some segment, or for
some segment: +
Segment Start < V.A. < Segment Start + Segment Bound.
. *Translate:* For the segment that contains this virtual address: +
 Physical Address = (V.A. - Segment Start) + Segment Base

[.nooutline]
== Segmentation: Cons

[.slider]
* Con: still requires *entire* segment be contiguous in memory!
* Con: potential for external fragmentation due to segment contiguity.

== Let's Regroup

[.slider]
.Ideally, what would we like?
* *Fast* mapping from _any_ virtual byte to _any_ physical byte.

[.slider]
* Operating system *cannot* do this. Can hardware help?

== Translation Lookaside Buffer

[.slider]
* Common systems trick: when something is too slow, throw a *cache* at
it.

== TLB Example

== What's the Catch?

[.slider]
* CAMs are *limited* in size. We cannot make them arbitrarily large.

[.slider]
.So at this point:
* *Segments* are too _large_ and lead to internal fragmentation.
* Mapping individual *bytes* would mean that the TLB would not be able
to cache many entries and performance would suffer.

[.slider]
* Is there a middle ground?

== Pages

Modern solution is to choose a translation granularity that is [.slide]*small
enough* to limit internal fragmentation but [.slide]*large* enough to allow the
TLB to cache entries covering a significant amount of memory.

[.slider]
* Also limits the size of kernel data structures associated with memory
management.

[.slide]
--
Execution *locality* also helps here: processes memory accesses are typically
highly spatially _clustered_, meaning that even a small cache can be very
effective.
--

== Page Size

[.slider]
* 4K is a very common page size. 8K or larger pages are also sometimes used.
* 4K pages and a 128-entry TLB allow caching translations for 1 MB of
memory.
* You can think of pages as *fixed size* segments, so the *bound* is the
same for each.

== Page Translation

[.slider]
* We refer to the portion of the virtual address that identifies the
page as the *virtual page number (VPN)* and the remainder as the
*offset*.
* Virtual pages map to physical pages.
* All addresses inside a single virtual page map to the *same* physical
page.

[.slider]
. *Check:* for 4K pages, split 32-bit address into *virtual page number*
(top 20 bits) and offset (bottom 12 bits). Check if a virtual page to
physical page translation exists for this page.
. *Translate:* Physical Address = Physical Page + offset.

== TLB Management

[.slider]
.Where do entries in the TLB come from?
* The operating system loads them.

[.slider]
.What happens if a process tries to access an address that is *not* in the TLB?
* The TLB asks the operating system for help via a *TLB exception*. The
operating system must either load the mapping or figure out what to do
with the process. (Maybe boom.)

== Paging: Pros

[.slider]
* Maintains many of the pros of segmentation, which can be layered on
top of paging.
* Pro: can *organize* and *protect* regions of memory appropriately.
* Pro: better fit for *address spaces*. Even less internal fragmentation
than segmentation due to smaller allocation size.
* Pro: *no* external fragmentation due to fixed allocation size!

== Paging: Cons

[.slider]
* Con: requires per-page hardware translation. *Use hardware to help
us.*
* Con: requires per-page operating system state. *A lot of clever
engineering here.*

== Page State

[.slider]
.In order to keep the TLB up-to-date we need to be able to:
* *Store* information about each virtual page.
* *Locate* that information quickly.

== Page Table Entries (PTEs)

We refer to a single entry storing information about a single virtual
page used by a single process a *page table entry (PTE)*.

[.slider]
* (We will see in a few slides why we call them *page table* entries.)
* Can usually jam everything into one 32-bit machine word:
** *Location*: 20 bits. (Physical Page Number or location on disk.)
** *Permissions*: 3 bits. (Read, Write, Execute.)
** *Valid*: 1 bits. Is the page located in memory?
** *Referenced*: 1 bits. Has the page been read/written to recently?

== Locating Page State

[.slider]
* _Process:_ "Machine! Store to address `0x10000`!"
* _MMU:_ "Where the heck is virtual address `0x10000` supposed to map to?
Kernel...help!"
* (Exception.)
* _Kernel_: Let's see... where did I put that page table entry for
`0x10000`... just give me a minute... I know it's around here somewhere...
I really should be more organized!

[.slider]
.What are the requirements for how we locate page information?
* *Speed*: translation is a _hot path_ and should be as efficient as
possible.
* *Compactness*: data structures we use should not take up too much
physical memory.

== Page Tables

The data structure used to quickly map a *virtual page number* to a *page
table entry* is called a *page table*.

[.slider]
* Each process has a _separate_ page table.
* *Why?* [.slide]#Virtual addresses are private to each process and
translated differently for each.#

== Flat Page Tables

*Approach*: use one array to hold all page table entries for each process.
Virtual page number is index into this array.

== Flat Page Tables

* *Approach*: use one array to hold all page table entries for each
process. Virtual page number is index into this array.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(1). VPN is used directly as an index into the array.
* *Compactness*: *4 MB* per process that may have to be *contiguous*!
Most is *unused*!

== Linked List Page Tables

[.slider]
* *Approach*: list of PTEs for each process, searched on each
translation.

== Linked List Page Tables

*Approach*: list of PTEs for each process, searched on each
translation.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(n) for n valid virtual pages.
* *Compactness*: *4 bytes * n* for n valid virtual pages. All entries
are used!

== [.spelling_exception]#An Early ASST3 K.I.S.S.:#

Don't feel like you have to do something overly complicated for ASST3!
First get it right, then optimize.

== Multi-Level Page Tables

*Approach*: build a tree-like data structure mapping VPN to PTE. Break
VPN into multiple parts, each used as an index at a separate level of
the tree.

[.slider]
* Example: with 4K pages VPN is *20* bits. Use *top 10* bits as index
into *top-level* page table, *bottom 10 bits* as index into second-level
page table.
** Each page table is 2^10^ * 4 bytes = 4K. Convenient!

== Multi-Level Page Tables

Build a tree-like data structure mapping VPN to PTE. Break VPN into multiple
parts, each used as an index at a separate level of the tree.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(c). Constant number of look ups per translation depending on
tree depth.
* *Compactness*: Depends on sparsity of address space, but better than
flat and worse than linked list.
