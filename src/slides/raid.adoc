== Today

* Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID).

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* Do ASST3!
* Max score is 69/100--getting there!

== Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks

[.slider]
.What kind of paper is this?
* *Big idea* paper!
* Spawned a commonly-used technology, an entire industry, and lots of similar
approaches.

[.slider]
.What is the big idea? (Hint: it has nothing to do with disks...)
* Several cheap things can be better than one expensive thing!

[.slider]
.Where else do we see this idea applied today?
* Multicore processors.
* Google.
* Crowdsourcing.

[.small]
== RAID: Problems

[.slider]
.What is the problem that the RAID paper identifies?
* Computer CPUs are getting faster...
* Computer memory is getting faster...
* Hard drives are not keeping up!

[.slide]
____
While we can imagine improvements in software file systems via buffering for
near term I/O demands, we need innovation to avoid an I/O crisis.
____

[.slider]
.What is the problem with the RAID solution?
* Many cheap things fail much more frequently than one expensive thing.
* So need a plan to handle failures.

== RAID 1

.RAID 1 (Mirroring)
* Two duplicate disks.
* Writes must go to both disks, reads can
come from either.

[.slider]
* Performance: [.slide]*better for reads.*
* Capacity: [.slide]*unchanged!*

[.small]
== RAID 2

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/RAID2_arch.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 2
* *Byte-level striping*, single error disk.
* *Hamming codes* to detect failures and correct errors.
* Most reads and writes require all disks.

[.slider]
* Capacity: [.slide]*improved.*

[.small]
== RAID 3

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/RAID_3.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 3
* *Only correct errors* since disks can detect when they fail.
* Byte-level striping, single *parity* disk.
* Most reads and writes require all disks.

[.slider]
* Capacity: [.slide]*improved.*

[.small]
== RAID 4

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/RAID_4.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 4
* *Block-level striping*, single parity disk.
* Better distribution of reads between disks due to larger stripe size,
* but all writes all must access the parity disk.

[.slider]
* Performance: [.slide]*improved for reads.*

[.small]
== RAID 5 (Full Victory)

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/RAID_5.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 5
* Block-level striping
* *Multiple parity disks*.
* Better distribution of writes between disks.

[.slider]
* Performance: [.slide]*improved for writes.*

== RAID 0 (Non-RAID)

.RAID 0
* Each disk stores half of the data.
* No error correction or redundancy.

[.slider]
* Performance: [.slide]*fantastic!*
* Capacity: [.slide]*fantastic!*
* Redundancy: [.slide]*ZERO!*

== RAID: Redundancy

[.slider]
* RAID arrays can tolerate the failure of one (or more) disks.
* Once a (or several) fail, the array is vulnerable to data loss.
* An administrator must replace the disk(s) and then rebuild the array.

== RAID: Questions?

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

* Operating system design.
