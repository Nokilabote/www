== Systems Are More Complicated Than Algorithms

(Don't tell [.spelling_exception]#Atri#.)

[.slider]
.Why is designing a computer system different from designing an algorithm?
* "The external interface (that is, the requirement) is less precisely
defined, more complex, and more subject to change."
* "The system has much more internal structure, and hence many internal
interfaces."
* "The measure of success is much less clear."

____
I have designed and built a number of computer systems, some that worked and
some that didnâ€™t. I have also used and studied many other systems, both
successful and unsuccessful. From this experience come some general hints for
designing successful systems. I claim no originality for them; most are part
of the folk wisdom of experienced designers. Nonetheless, even the expert
often forgets, and after the second system [6] comes the fourth one.
