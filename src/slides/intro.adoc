== Why I'm Here

[options='step']
* I took CS161 @ Harvard--now also known as CSE 421/521 at the
  University at Buffalo--from Margo Seltzer in 2001
* At that point I was a physics major, but I wouldn't be for long..
* ...because I discovered that I loved building computer systems and teaching
  people about them.
* I would up in graduate school (where I TA'd this course many times).
* And graduate school landed me right back here to begin the cycle again.

== Introducing the 2015 Course Staff

We probably have the best course staff ever this year--a mixture of both a
core of veteran TAs assisted by a large group of volunteers.

.Teaching Assistants
[options='step']
. *Jinghao Shi*: second year TA, wrote the definitive CSE 421/521 blog/help
guide
. *Guru Prasad Srinivasa*: third-year TA, actual Linux kernel hacker
. *Zihe Chen*: third-year TA

[options='step']
--
Jinghao will teach recitations, Guru will supervise office hours, and Zihe
will lead--but not do all of--the online grading.
--

<<<

[.small]
--
.Ninjas:
[options='step']
. *Jerry Antony Ajay*: just knows stuff
. *Yihong Chen*: 2014 student
. *Scott Florentino*: 2014 student
. *James Mazur*: 2014 student
. *Carl Nuessle*: 2014 ninja
. *Natasha Sanford*: 2014 student
. *Sriram Shantharam*: 2014 student
. *Ryan Smith*: 2014 student
. *Mack Ward*: 2014 student
--

[options='step']
--
You'll see the ninjas during office hours but they will not do any grading.
--

== Operating Systems Briefly Defined

.Operating System:
[options='step']
. A *computer program* that
. *multiplexes hardware resources* and
. *implements useful abstractions*.

[options='step']
--
The OS is just another computer program! [slide]#(If a large,
complex, mature and mission critical one.)#
--

[options='step']
--
*Multiplexing* allows multiple people or programs to use the same set of
hardware resources--processors, memory, disks, network connection--safely and
efficiently.
--

[options='step']
--
*Abstractions*--processes, threads, address spaces, files, and
sockets--simplify the usage of hardware resources by organizing information
or implementing new capabilities.
--

== Motivating This Class

[options='step']
* How many of you have participated in OS development?
* How many of you regularly program in languages that use operating system
abstractions directly?
* So why study operating systems? Why is this class even offered? *Why is it
required?*

[.meme-bottom]
What's this for again?

== Why Study Operating Systems?

[options='step']
* *Reality*: this is how computers really work, and as a computer scientist or
  engineer you should know how computers really work.
* *Ubiquity*: operating systems are everywhere and you are likely to eventually
  encounter them or their limitations.
* *Beauty*: operating systems are examples of mature solutions to difficult
  design and engineering problems. Studying them will improve your ability to
  design and implement abstractions.

== Why Program Operating Systems?

[options='step']
* *Design*: programming operating systems stresses the importance of careful
  design and specification before coding begins. You will learn the value of
  design, probably the hard way.
* *Difficulty*: operating systems are large existing code bases where new
  solutions have stringest performance requirements. Programming operating
  systems will make you a better programmer and improve all of your subsequent
  work.
* *Debugging*: debugging operating systems is challenging due to their multi-
  threaded nature and the lack of typical debugging support provided to
  applications. Again, debugging operating systems will sharpen your debugging
  skills.

== Course Structure

[options='step']
* Conceptual learning...
[options='step']
** Lectures
** Recitations
** Exams
* ...by doing (programming).

== Learning Objectives: Conceptual

.When you finish CSE 421/521 you will:
[options='step']
. understand the abstractions supported by modern operating systems
. be able to describe how operating systems policies and mechanisms safely
  and efficiently multiplex hardware resources
. be able to analyze historical, current, and emerging operating system
  designs and features

[options='step']
--
The main way we will know that you are learning is by your participation in
class and recitations.
--
[options='step']
--
You will be tested for mastery on exams.
--

== Conceptual Progression

[.small,options='step']
* Introduction to operating system abstractions and structure.
* Abstracting and multiplexing:
[options='step']
** the CPU--interrupts, context, threads, processes, processor scheduling,
   thread synchronization.
** memory--memory layout, address translation, paging and segmentation,
   address spaces, translation caching, page fault handling, page eviction,
** swapping.
** storage--spinning disks and Flash, spinning disk scheduling, on-disk
   layout, files, buffer cache, crash and recovery.
* Virtualization.
* Networking (time permitting)

== Learning the Concepts

[options='step']
* Attend class.
* Come to class on time:
** Music starts as soon as I can get into the room...
** Lectures will start at 2:05PM sharp and finish by 2:50PM.
* Ask questions during class.
** I'm very flexible about how much we cover this semester.
** I would rather teach less and have everyone understand it.
** Our back-and-forth during class is the one of the few indicators I have of
   how much you are absorbing...

--
We will know that you are learning by your participation in class, recitations,
and office hours, and your use of online testing resources.
--
--
You will be tested for mastery by each programming assignment.

== OS/161

* OS/161 is an instructional operating system developed by David Holland at
  Harvard University.
* It attempts to strike a balance between Linux and other extremely-mature
  systems--too difficult to hack on--and existing instructional operating
  systems frameworks--not realistic enough.
* Your OS/161 kernel runs in an emulator, `sys161`, which emulates an MIPS r2000/
  r3000 instruction set architecture (ISA).
* Using `sys161` allows us to simplify debugging and hardware support.

== 10,000 Hours

[options='step']
* While many operating systems concepts are elegantly simple, implementing them
  is not.
* Therefor, this class is not easy:
** [red]#3.52 (-0.57)# and [red]#4.03 (-0.06)# on "Appropriate Workload"
   score in 2013 course evaluations for 421 and 521 respectively (90%+ response rate).
* However, this class is also worthwhile:
** [green]#4.14 (+0.31)# and [green]#4.59 (+0.76)# overall rating (2013).

[.nooutline]
== Questions about Content?

== ops-class.org Website

[options='step']
* It's ready! (This has never happened before _before_ the first day of class...)
* But it should actually be all operational, meaning that you can start on
  ASST0 once you have a partner and upload an SSH key.
* There is also a lot of helpful information on using Git, finding a partner,
  submitting assignments, using Eclipse, and other tidbits, along with the
  syllabus, links to lecture videos, etc.
* *Please get started quickly! ASST0/ASST1 are in less than three weeks!*

== Grading

[.small]
--
[options='step']
* Conceptual--(50%)
** 5%--Preterm Exam (Wednesday)
** 15%--Midterm Exam
** 30%--Final Exam
* Programming--(50%)
** 5%--ASST0
** 10%--ASST1
** 15%--ASST2
** 20%--ASST3
--

[options='step']
--
The preterm exam is free points: 5% for showing up and doing your best.
If you do not take the preterm your midterm and final exam scores will be
scaled appropriately.
--

== Continuous Choose-Your-Own Grade Programming Evaluations

[options='step']
* Almost all assignment grading in CSE421/521 is automated.
* Therefore... you can have your code graded repeatedly whenever you like.
* Therefore... you can stop each assignment whenever you are satisfied with
  your grade.
* Note that, unlike last year, all human-graded components (codereading
questions and designs) can *only be submitted once*.
** Sorry: twice the number of students, same number of TAs!

== Continuous Choose-Your-Own Grade Details and Caveats

[options='step']
* Assignments are done in pairs, so find a partner who is interested in
  achieving the same grade as you are.
** The website has more advice on this...
* Note that we do not allow students to work alone except in extremely unusual
  circumstances.
** "I want to work alone" does not represent one of these situations!
* You may not bang against or try to flummox our automated grader.
* Assignments are cumulative and we will not distribute solution sets without
a significant penalty.

== Communication

* If we haven't already, we will sign you all up for a mass email list. If you
  would like to sign up yourself, please go to http://www.ops-class.org/mailman/listinfo/ub.
* We also have a Piazza forum linked off the website which is the best way to
  get help quickly.

== Using Email

[options='step']
* If you need to email the course staff (#staff@ops-class.org#), please consider
  the following:
[options='step']
** Is this information likely to be available on the website? If yes, go find it!
** Is the answer to this question likely to benefit other students? If yes, use Piazza.
* Before you email me directly, please also consider the following:
** Is this something that the course staff could answer? If yes, email them.
* Here's the bottom line: the more time we spend answering repetitive email,
  the less time we have available to help you with real problems.

== Getting Help: Recitations

* Jinghao will be holding recitations. Unfortunately recitations this year
  are for undergraduates only and one is at 8AM.
** If this upsets you, please complain to Aidong Zhang, the CSE department
   chair. 
* Recitations this year will cover a mix of conceptual and assignment-driven
  material.

== Getting Help: Office Hours

[.small]
--
[options='step']
* All three TAs and ten Ninjas will be holding office hours.
** We are hoping to have around 40 hours of office hours scheduled per week,
    meaning that you have plenty of opportunities to complete the challenging
    CSE 421 assignments.
** Please complete the Doodle poll linked off of the website so we know when
    to schedule office hours.
* Office hours are the best place to get help on the programming assignments.
* CSE 421/521 office hours will be in Davis Hall in locations announced on the
  calendar, but probably near Davis 301B or in the Second Floor atrium.
* Just come in and do the assignments during office hours--that way, when you
  get stuck, you are in the right place.
--

== Getting Help: Working in Pairs

Partner groups are jointly responsible for joint work.

[options='step']
* If any part is plagiarized, both partners fail.
* If any part is plagiarized, both partners fail.
* If you have concerns about work your partner has submitted, immediately
   approach the course staff.
* If you do not we will assume later that your consent was given.
* It is entirely your responsibility to ensure that your team's submission
   is fair and reflects your contributions.

Pair programming assignments for CSE 421/521 are very clear about what kinds
of collaboration are permitted. We consider violating these expectations to
be cheating.

== Getting Help: Helping Each Other

[options='step']
* The course staff will be working as hard as you--and sometimes harder--but
  there are many of you and few of us. Look to your left and your right: these
  are your comrades.
* Good classes come through CSE 421/521 as a team.

== Collaboration

* Simple rule: talking about code is collaborating, talking in code (or
  exchanging code) is cheating.
** Unless you are talking to your partner in which case anything goes.

== Cheaters

* I take cheating very seriously:
[options='step']
** Not because I am vindictive and mean...
** ... but because I believe in protecting and honoring those of you that
   work hard and play by the rules.

No matter how long it takes

== Cheaters

* We will use an online service to detect and investigating code similarity.
[options='step']
** It is very fast, so we can it on every submission.
** It is very accurate.
** We will compare your assignment against everything we can think of: this
   years', last years', anything you can find online, assignments submitted at
   Harvard, etc.
