== Today

* Finding data blocks
* Caching and consistency

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

== `ext4` inodes

== Locating inodes

[.slider]
.How does the system translate an inode number into an inode structure?
* All inodes are created at *format time* at well-known locations.

[.slider]
.What are the consequences of this?
* *inodes may not be located near file contents.* `ext4` creates multiple
blocks of inodes within the drive to reduce seek times between inodes and
data.
* Fixed number of inodes for the file system. *Can run out of inodes before we
run out of data blocks!* `ext4` creates approximately one inode per 16 KB of
data blocks, but this can be configured at format time.

== Directories

Simply a *special file* the contents of which map inode numbers to relative
names.

== File System Names are inode Numbers, Directories Are Files

== Using `debugfs`

== Using `debugfs`

== `open`: Path Name Translation

`open("/etc/default/keyboard")` must translate [.slide]`"/etc/default/keyboard"`
to an [.slide]*inode number.*

[.slider]
. Get inode number for *root directory*. This is usually a fixed
agreed-on inode number, like *2*.
. Open the directory with inode number 2. Look for `"etc"`. Find `"etc"`
with inode number *393218*.
. Open the directory with inode number 393218. Look for `"default"`.
Find `"default"` with inode number *393247*.
. Open the directory with inode number 393247. Look for `"keyboard"`.
Find keyboard with inode number *394692*.
. Open the file with inode number 394692.

== `read`/`write`: Retrieving and Modifying Data Blocks

[.slider]
* `read/write(filehandle, 345)` must translate [.slide]#345# to a
[.slide]#*data block* within the open file to determine what data block to
modify.#
* There are multiple ways of doing this.

== Data Blocks: Linked List

One solution: organize data blocks into a *linked list*.

[.slider]
* inode contains a pointer to the first data block.
* Each data block contains a pointer to the previous and next data
block.

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Simple.
* Small amount of information in inode.

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Offset look ups are *slow*! O(n) in the size of the file.

== Data Blocks: Flat Array

A second solution: store all data blocks in the inode in a single
array allocate at file creation time.

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Also simple.
* Offset look ups are fast, O(1).

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Small file size fixed at startup time.
* Large portion of array may be unused.

== Data Blocks: Multilevel Index

Observation: *most* files are small, but *some* can get very large.

[.slider]
.Have inode store:
* some pointers to blocks, which we refer to as *direct* blocks.
* some pointers to blocks containing pointers to blocks, which we refer
to as *indirect* blocks.
* some pointers to blocks containing pointers to blocks containing
pointers to blocks, which we refer to as *doubly indirect* blocks.
* etc...

== Data Blocks: Multilevel Index

image::figures/disks/multilevelindexblocks.svg[image]

== Data Blocks: Multilevel Index

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Index scales with the size of the file.
* Offset look ups are still fairly fast.
* Small files stay small, but big files can get extremely large.

== Making File Systems Fast

[.slider]
.How do we make a big slow thing look faster?
* *Use a cache!* (Put a smaller, faster thing in front of it.)

[.slide]
--
In the case of the file system the smaller, faster thing is *memory*.
We call the memory used to cache file system data the *buffer cache*.
--

== Putting Spare Memory To Work

[.slider]
.Operating systems use memory:
* *as memory* (duh), but also
* to cache file data in order to improve performance.

[.slider]
.These two uses of memory *compete* with each other.
* *Big* buffer cache, *small* main memory: [.slide]#file access is fast, but
potential thrashing in the memory subsystem...#
* *Small* buffer cache, *large* main memory: [.slide]#little swapping occurs but
file access is extremely slow.#

[.slide]
--
On Linux the `swappiness` kernel parameter controls how aggressively
the operating system prunes unused process memory pages and hence the
balance between memory and buffer cache.

== Above the File System

[.slider]
.What do we cache?
* *Entire files and directories!*

.What is the buffer cache interface?
* `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`. (Same as the file system call interface.)

[.small]
== Above the File System: Operations

[.slider]
.`open`
* Pass down to underlying file system.

[.slider]
.`read`
* If file is not in the buffer cache, pass down to underlying
file system and load contents into the buffer cache.
* If the file is in the cache, return the cached contents.

[.slider]
.`write`
* If file is not in the buffer cache, pass load contents into the
buffer cache and then modify them.
* If the file is in the cache, modify the cached contents.

[.slider]
.`close`
* Remove from the cache (if necessary) and flush contents through the file system.

== Above the File System: Pros and Cons

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Buffer cache sees file operations, may lead to better prediction or
performance.

.Cons:
* Hides many file operations from the file system, preventing it from
providing consistency guarantees.
* Can't cache file system metadata: inodes, superblocks, etc.

== Below the File System

[.slider]
.What do we cache?
* *Disk blocks!*

[.slider]
.What is the buffer cache interface?
* `readblock`, `writeblock`. (Same as the disk interface.)

== Below the File System: Pros and Cons

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Can cache all blocks including file system data structures, inodes,
superblocks, etc.
* Allows file system to see all file operations even if they eventually
hit the cache.

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Cannot observe file semantics or relationships.

[.slide]

This is what modern operating systems do.

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

* Consistency and caching.
* Journaling.
