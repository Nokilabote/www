== Today

* Paging.
* Swapping.

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* This is it! ASST2 is due today.
* Midterm will cover everything through today.
* No recitation Friday.
* ASST2 turn-in party today after class, in and around Davis 303.

== Pages

Modern solution is to choose a translation granularity that is [.slide]*small
enough* to limit internal fragmentation but [.slide]*large* enough to allow the
TLB to cache entries covering a significant amount of memory.

[.slide]
--
[.slide]#Execution *locality* also helps here#: processes memory accesses are typically
highly spatially _clustered_, meaning that even a small cache can be very
effective.
--

[.nooutline]
== Page Size

[.slider]
* 4K is a very common page size. 8K or larger pages are also sometimes used.
* You can think of pages as *fixed size* segments, so the *bound* is the
same for each.

[.nooutline]
== Page Translation

[.nooutline]
[.slider]
* We refer to the portion of the virtual address that identifies the
page as the [.slide]*virtual page number (VPN)* and the remainder as the
[.slide]*offset*.
* Virtual pages map to physical pages.

[.nooutline]
== TLB Management

[.slider]
.Where do entries in the TLB come from?
* The operating system loads them.

[.slider]
.What happens if a process tries to access an address that is *not* in the TLB?
* The TLB asks the operating system for help via a *TLB exception*. The
operating system must either load the mapping or figure out what to do
with the process. (Maybe boom.)

[.nooutline]
== Page State

[.slider]
.In order to keep the TLB up-to-date we need to be able to:
* *Store* information about each virtual page.
* *Locate* that information quickly.

[.nooutline]
== Multi-Level Page Tables

A tree-like data structure mapping VPN to PTE. Break
VPN into multiple parts, each used as an index at a separate level of
the tree.

* *Speed*: [.slide]#O(c). Constant number of look ups per translation depending on
tree depth.#
* *Compactness*: [.slide]#Depends on sparsity of address space, but better than
flat and worse than linked list.#

== Questions About Pages and Page Tables?

== Out of Core

So far we have been talking about cases where processes are able to use
the physical memory available on the machine.

[.slide]

But what happens when we *run out*?

== Out of Core

When we *run out*, there are two options:
[.slider]
. *Fail*, and either don't load the process (`exec()`), don't create a
new process (`fork()`), refuse to allocate more heap (`sbrk()`), or kill the
process if it is trying to allocate more stack.

. *Create more space*, preserving the contents of memory for later use.

== Virtually Sneaky

Virtual address translation gives the kernel the ability to remove
memory from a process *behind its back*.

[.slider]
.What are the requirements for doing this?
* The _last time_ the process used the virtual address, it behaved like
memory.
* The _next time_ the process uses the virtual address, it behaves like
memory.
* In between, whatever data was stored at that address must be
*preserved*.

== Swapping

[.slider]
* The place operating systems typically place data stored in memory in
order to borrow the memory from the process is *on disk*.
* We call the process of moving data back and forth from memory to disk
in order to improve memory usage *swapping*.
* *Goal:* when swapping is done well your system *feels* like it has
memory that is as _large_ as the size of the disk but as _fast_ as
actual RAM.
* Unfortunately, when swapping is not done well your system *feels* like
it has memory that is as _small_ as RAM and as _slow_ as the disk.

== TLB v. Page Faults

[.slider]
.We distinguish between two kinds of memory-related fault:
* *TLB Fault:* a required virtual to physical address translation is
not in the TLB.
* *Page Fault:* the contents of a virtual page are either not
initialized or not in memory.

[.slider]
._Every_ page fault is preceded by a TLB fault.
* If the contents of the virtual page are not in memory, a translation
cannot exist for it!

[.slider]
._Not every_ TLB fault generates a page fault.
* If page is in memory and the translation is the page table, the TLB
fault can be handled without generating a page fault.

== Swap Out

[.slider]
.To swap a page to disk we must:
. *Remove* the translation from the TLB, if it exists.
. *Copy* the contents of the page to disk.
. *Update* the page table entry to indicate that the page is on disk.

== Swap Out Speed

[.slider]
. *Remove* the translation from the TLB: [.slide]#fast.#
. *Copy* the contents of the page to disk: [.slide.spelling_exception]*sloooowwww...*
. *Update* the page table entry to indicate that the page is on disk:
[.slide]#fast.#

== Page Cleaning

Frequently when we are swapping out a page it is in order to allocate
new memory to a running process, or possibly to swap _in_ a page.

So it would be *great* if swapping out were fast.

[.slider]
.Can we prepare the system to optimize swap out?
* *Yes!*

[.slider]
* Each page has a dedicated place on disk.
* During idle periods operating system writes data from active memory
pages to swap disk.
* Pages with matching content on the swap disk are called *clean*.
* Pages that do not match their swap disk content are called *dirty*.

[.small]
== Swap In

[.slider]
.When *must* we swap in a page?
* When the virtual address is used by the process!

[.slider]
.To translate a virtual address used by a process that points to a page that has been swapped out, we must:
.  *Stop* the instruction that is trying to translate the address until
we can retrieve the contents.
.  *Allocate* a page in memory to hold the new page contents.
.  *Locate* the page on disk using the page table entry.
.  *Copy* the contents of the page from disk.
.  *Update* the page table entry to indicate that the page is in
memory.
.  *Load* the TLB.
.  *Restart* the instruction that was addressing the virtual address we
retrieved.

== (On) Demand Paging

Sometimes procrastination is useful, particularly when you end up
*never* having to do the thing you're being asked to do!

[.slider]
* _Process:_ Kernel! Load this huge chunk of code into my address space!
* _Kernel:_ Well, I'm kind of busy now, so maybe later? But I'll make a
note of it!
* _Process:_ Kernel! Give me 4 MB more heap!
* _Kernel:_ Your request is granted, but come back and ask again when
you *really* need it.

== (On) Demand Paging

[.slider]
.Until:
* an instruction on a code page is *executed*, or
* a *read* or *write* occurs to a data or heap page.
* the kernel does *not* load the contents of that page into memory!

[.slider]
.Why not?
* A *lot* of code is never executed and some global variables are never
used. *Why waste memory?*

== Demanded Paging

[.slider]
.What happens the first time a process executes an instruction from a new code page?
* That page contents are loaded from disk and the instruction is restarted.

[.slider]
.What happens the first time a does a load or store to an uninitialized heap, stack or data page?
* The kernel allocates a new page filled with zeros and the instruction
is restarted.

== Aside: Hardware-Managed TLBs

[.slider]
* On certain architectures the MMU will search the page table *itself*
to locate virtual-to-physical address translations missing from the TLB.
** *Pro*: hardware is faster!
** *Con*: operating system must set up the page tables in a fixed way
that the hardware understands.
* With a hardware-managed TLB, the kernel never sees TLB faults: they
are handled in hardware.
* Don't worry: System/161 has a *software-managed* TLB, so you get to do
all of the hard work *and* design your own page table structures!

[.nooutline]
== Next Time (After the Midterm)

[.slider]
* Page replacement algorithms. How do we choose a page to remove?
